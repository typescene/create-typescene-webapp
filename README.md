# Create Typescene Web App

Create front end applications with the Typescene framework, using the command line (CLI).

## Getting Started

You'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer, but you do **not** need to install anything else.

To create a new app in a folder named `my-webapp`, run the following command in the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
npx create-typescene-webapp my-webapp
```

This will create a folder *inside* the current folder, copy source files, and install packages using NPM.

After installation, run the following commands to start a development server and open your default browser:

```bash
cd my-webapp
npm run start
```

## Options

You may use the following command line arguments to configure the installation.

| Argument        | Effect |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `--js`          | Use JS (ES6) only, instead of TypeScript |
| `--jsx`          | Include JSX (TSX) support |
| `--bundler=`... | Use a specific bundler (either `webpack` or `parcel`) |
| `--git`         | Initialize a Git repository |
| `--yarn`         | Use Yarn instead of NPM |
| `--overwrite`   | Force overwrite existing files |
